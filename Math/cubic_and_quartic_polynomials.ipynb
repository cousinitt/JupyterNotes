    "Usually, I would just use a numerical algorithm, but this was just too neat for me to pass up. Even [the history](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-scandalous-history-of-the-cubic-formula-20220630/) of how these methods were discovered is interesting. It started in Italy in the sixteenth century, before the discovery of complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the cubic and the quartic, we start by standardizing the equations. This is not a lecture on the method, but rather a listing of steps. The interested reader is referred to the voluminous literature on polynomials for more details. First, we divide through by the leading coefficient to make the polynomial [monic ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monic_polynomial)(first coefficient is 1). Next, we depress the polynomial. This means that a polynomial of degree $n$ will be missing the term of degree $n âˆ’ 1$. This simplifies the analysis.\n",
